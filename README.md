# Stack Graphs playground

This is an experiment to see if we can have an interesting UI for/visualization of the stack graphs pathfinding algorithm. As of now the only thing implemented is the graph primitives. The pathfinding algorithm is a WIP.

The implementation is in PureScript and closely follows [the Rust implementation](github.com/github/stack-graphs). It is very imperative and operates largely in the `ST` monad.
